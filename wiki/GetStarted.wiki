= Introduction =

At Present Crowl can only crawl RSS and ATOM feeds. 0.1 is the minimalist version of Crowl , it does not have any distributed capabilities. Also it is lacking any good machine learning functionality. 

Crowl 0.1 has following features:

  * It can crawl a single feed url e.g. "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&output=rss"
  * It can crawl a collection of feed urls passed as List of URL
  * Gives HTML free content of a feed entry.
  * Gives Image url in a feed

= Usage =
Following code snippet parses a single rss feed:
{{{
 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ICrawler crawler = new FeedCrawler();
        try {
            List<FeedEntry> lis =crawler.crawlSingleUrl(new URL("http://feeds.feedburner.com/basho/knDR"));
            for(FeedEntry fe: lis)
            {                
                SyndEntry se = fe.getFeedEntry();                            
                System.out.println("Title: "+se.getTitle()+"\n"+"Content: "+fe.getNoHtmlContent()+"\n"+"Image URL: "+fe.getFeedImageUrl());
            }
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    }
}}}
