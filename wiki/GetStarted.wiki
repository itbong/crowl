= Introduction =

At Present Crowl can only crawl RSS and ATOM feeds. 0.1 is the minimalist version of Crowl , it does not have any distributed capabilities. Also it is lacking any good machine learning functionality. 

Crowl 0.1 has following features:

  * It can crawl a single feed url e.g. "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&output=rss"
  * It can crawl a collection of feed urls passed as List of URL
  * Gives HTML free content of a feed entry.
  * Gives Image url in a feed
